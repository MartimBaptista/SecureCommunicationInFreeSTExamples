# FreeST Secure Communication Examples

This repository contains code examples demonstrating the use of **FreeST secure communication channels**. The examples illustrate how Alice and Bob communicate, how secure channels are established, and how intruders like Eve can intercept messages in different scenarios.

## ðŸ“– Overview

The examples cover the following:

- **Basic communication** without secure channels.
- **Secure communication** using the `SecureChannel` module.
- **Eavesdropper intruder** attempting to eavesdrop without altering messages.
- **Bit-flipping Intruder** attempting to tamper with communication.
- **MITM attack** attempting to attack the establishment of the secure channel.


These examples are intended to complement the explanations provided in the thesis/report and serve as a hands-on reference for how FreeST offers secure communication.
